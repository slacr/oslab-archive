# Administrivia archive

A repository of administrative scripts and as a backup of selected configuration files. Not actively used by the current SLACR interns, but they've come in handy a couple of times.
 
See [our administrative page](http://trac.evergreen.edu/wiki/OSLab) for general information about the administration of the cluster.
