The Scientific Lab for Academic Computing Research (SLACR) Lab for Advanced Computing Research Labs (ACRL) Computing Research Lab (SLACRL) is a joint 
project initiated by advanced Computer Science students and Computer Science faculty.  Currently the lab is structured around a cluster of 23 computers. The students and faculty involved in this project have focused on two significant goals for the SLACRL. First, the construction of a physical infrastructure and set of opportunities for advanced hands on learning in Computer Science that can be integrated into the curriculum. Second, the building of relationships between computer science and other departments enabling CS students to create distributed computing software tailored to specific research applications. Utilizing modern cluster computing methods students and faculty will be able to expand their research in ways only available at larger universities. By establishing our lab as a site for such collaborative work we hope to redefine Computer Science at Evergreen as not just a tool to other sciences, but as an independent field of research that can both advance our work in computer science and provide meaningful support to other scientific study at Evergreen.
