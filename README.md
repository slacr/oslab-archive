# OSLab SVN Repository

Files rescued from the old trac svn, committed to github.

The examples directory is still maintained for our wiki tutorials (and is thus a submodule), the rest has fallen to the grips of time. The projects were forged by past interns; if they or someone else took them up again they'd likely get their own repo. But until then, they lie here in cryogenic sleep.

*NOTE: As of right now, the pages linked here are accessible only on Evergreen's network. Contact us if you'd like access offsite and we'll try to work something out.*

## Examples
examples/ contains a number of tutorial-based example code for the different libraries and frameworks found in the SLACR Lab. Because they're still used and actively maintained, it's a submodule here linking to [slacr/examples](http://github.com/slacr/examples).

Point your browser to [our wiki's Learn page](http://slacr.evergreen.edu/wiki/index.php/Learn) to see
the accompanying tutorials.

## Projects

This is a collection of student projects written within or with the OSLab throughout the years bygone. Their completion status is unknown. If you're interested in updating, maintaining, or forking a particular project, let us know.

See the online documentation at [our wiki's Projects page.](http://slacr.evergreen.edu/wiki/index.php/Projects)

## Administrivia

A repository of administrative scripts and as a backup of selected configuration files. Not actively used by the current SLACR interns, but they've come in handy a couple of times.

See [our administrative page](http://trac.evergreen.edu/wiki/OSLab) for general information about the
administration of the cluster.

## Archive

This is a collection of pre 2011-2012 material that was salvaged and archived.
New stuff should generally not go in here, but instead be documented and organized into one of examples/, projects/, or administrivia/
